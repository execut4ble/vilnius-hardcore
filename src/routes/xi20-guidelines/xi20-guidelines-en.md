**1. NAZI AFFILIATED SYMBOLISM FUCK OFF**

If the doorpeople call you out on your t-shirt or patch, don’t be surprised if you or your t-shirt get tossed out. No whining about ‘I just like the music/wearing it ironically’. You know where you came, don’t be a dumbfuck. Same goes for nazi affiliated gestures and language.

**2. COME TO THE CONCERT, NOT TO GET WASTED**

No need to open vodka before the gig even starts and then puke all over the place for someone else to clean up. Take care of yourself and your friends, drink some water and come for the music, not for booze fest. Accept the doorpeople’s decision to kick out shitfaced dumbfucks.

**3. SNORTERS STRICTLY FUCK OFF**

If we catch you snorting, you’re out. No talk, no excuses. This is your warning.

**4. DON’T SMOKE IN THE CONCERT HALL**

Doesn’t matter if it’s cigarettes, vapes or iqos farts. Take it outside or hit the S-M-O-K-I-N-G A-R-E-A for our and your comfort. We wanna hear music and party without the extra tar and lead in our lungs - the air’s hard enough to breathe in here without your smoke.

**5. DON’T PISS AND SHOUT OUTSIDE - DON’T PISS OFF THE NEIGHBOURS**

Don’t trash our beloved courtyard with your piss and shouting. If you really gotta go and the bathroom line’s too long, at least walk far enough so you can’t even see the building. We all enjoy hanging out by the cat when the weather’s good, but if you piss and scream, the neighbours call the cops, and the evening is fucked not just for you, but for everyone. If we have to deal with cops because of you, we don’t want to deal with you. Don’t be a dumbfuck.

**6. CAMERA WITH FLASH OFF AND TOWARDS THE STAGE ONLY**

Let's give people the freedom to dance, party, be weird and express themselves without the unease of getting into the sight of a camera. There’s already too little privacy in daily life, and XI20 is not a prop for your social media feed. If you really can’t drop the habit of snapping everything, aim your camera (flash off) at the performers on stage — that’s where the attention belongs :) Don’t get salty if we ask you to show and delete shots not aimed at the stage, and accept the doorpeople’s decision to kick out obnoxious photographers.

**7. DON’T HARASS AND DON’T TOUCH PEOPLE WITHOUT CONSENT**

We don’t tolerate harassment, cross the line and you’re out. If you see someone being harassed, don’t just stand by — speak up and act. Accept the doorpeople’s decision to kick dumbfucks out.

**8. DON’T DUMP YOUR STUFF WHEREVER**

Try not to come here with a million things. Use the rack in the hall, hand your backpack to a friend, or just keep it with you. Your junk = your problem, so don’t be surprised if you dump it somewhere and the mice drag it under the stairs :)

**9. LEARN HOW TO MOSH**

One can mosh like a dumbfuck (breaking teeth, ripping earrings, stomping hands and faces), but here we keep it friendly:

- NEVER PUSH PEOPLE INTO THE MOSHPIT. Only those who wanna mosh should mosh. If you’re on the edge holding the line, don’t push people in unless you’re 100% sure they want it. Don’t push folks in general — that’s how heads (and even toilet bowls) get smashed.

- DON’T SWING FOR THE SAKE OF SWINGING. Mosh is not about throwing elbows - it's not a fight. If wanna brawl, sign up for martial arts. Here you party and dance!

- DON’T BE MAD AT MOSHERS. Watch what’s happening around you. If a pit’s forming and you don’t wanna join, step aside and make space. If it really bothers you, stay out of the front where the pit usually happens.

- CATCH THE SURFERS / DON’T DIVE ON THREE PEOPLE. Pay attention to the crowd. Don’t stage dive on people who aren’t ready, and don’t let surfers crash to the floor!

- DITCH THE DRINKS. No one wants to get soaked by your beer, or worse - to slip on a lost bottle or split their head from a thrown can (yes, it happens more often than you think). Also, don’t put your drink on the stage or the speakers - there’s expensive gear, don’t be a dumbfuck.

- CHECK YOUR OUTFIT - leave your coolest spiky vest to friends, because spikes can unexpectedly hurt someone. Think about your bracelets, glasses or piercings, and make sure they don’t break, fall off, or hurt someone. Better to leave sharp and fancy stuff at home or with friends.

- PICK PEOPLE UP. Look out for each other, don’t let someone get trampled. If someone goes down, stop and help them up, and don’t push them back into the pit. They’ll jump in if they want to.

- HOLD LOST STUFF UP. If you see a phone, glasses or anything important on the floor, hold it up until the owner grabs it and thanks you. If the owner doesn’t appear, hand it to the crew at merch or the door.

- ACT RESPECTFULLY. Pay attention to who’s moshing with you, the tempo, the flow. Start a move if you want, but don’t go against the vibe — the music’s not just for you. And if someone pulls you out, don’t freak out — there’s probably a reason. Chill, stay friendly, and others will be friendly to you :)

**10. DON’T WANDER WHERE YOU DON’T BELONG**

While you’re having fun, folks here are working without money. Don’t hang out in crew spaces (behind the bar, in the kitchen, backstage). Give them room to work, talk, or just take a break.

**11. CLEAN-UP AFTER YOURSELF**

No one here is your personal MOM or cleaner — handle your own mess. There’s a trash can in the hall, boxes in the corners for bottles and cans. Trash bins are in the smoking area, and dumpsters are right outside. If something breaks or spills, let the doors know — we’ll give you a broom or whatever you need to clean it.

**AFTERWORD**

Maybe you read all this and gave yourself a pat on the back, because you are not a dumbfuck and know how to have fun responsibly. Nice! But there’s still a bit here for you:

XI20 is what we all make it, and keeping the fun rolling is everyone’s responsibility. If you see someone being a dumbfuck (being silly is welcome!) and annoying you or others - don’t wait for an overworked MOM to show up, step in and handle it yourself. If you’re shy, grab a friend for backup. If you’re unsure what to do, tell the crew.
